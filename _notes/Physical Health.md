Physical Health is so important in life and so heavily linked to [[Mental Health]], the Canadian Mental Health Association says [^1]:

>Nowhere is the relationship between mental and physical health more evident than in the area of chronic conditions. The associations between mental and physical health are:
>1. Poor mental health is a risk factor for chronic physical conditions.
>2. People with serious mental health conditions are at high risk of experiencing chronic physical conditions.
>3. People with chronic physical conditions are at risk of developing poor mental health.

From this one could take that concentrate on the [[Mental Health]] part of [[health]]and the [[Physical Health]] will follow on its own.  In my experience this is not quite true.  Poor [[Mental Health]] may increase the the chances of chronic physical conditions and most definitely makes it difficult much harder to solve the non chronic but as with all of the [[Life Driver|Life Driver's]] balance is the key you can not take care of one and expect the others to follow.

I do feel that once [[Physical Health|Physical]] issues become 'chronic' or even close regardless of the state with [[Mental Health]] it is an incredibly difficult balancing act to pull the [[Physical Health|Physical]] back up again.
