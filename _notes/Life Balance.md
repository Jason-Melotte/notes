When talking of life balance then the initial thought is around: *Work Life Balance* however I think that is only a very small part of the whole subject.

Life balance has to incorporate all aspects of life:
* Work
* Relationships
* Health
* Fun

Without a balance between them all happiness can never be achieved and life will immediately or eventually suck. It is around this that I came up with my [[Life Driver|Life Driver's]] as I felt if I could get them in the correct balance then I would find [[Happiness]] or at least [[Contentment]].

I do not believe that the correct balance is an equal split between my drivers, I also don't believe that the split stays the same through ones life and in some ways this is the primary challenge ensuring a balance through life changes even through the seasons of a year can be a tough thing to do.
