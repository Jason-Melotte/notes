Over the years I have suffered from physical pain in most parts of my body and what I have learned to remember is that unless the pain has been caused by something direct at that location  [direct impact or cut to hand etc.::lmn] the [[Root Cause]] of that pain is probably from something that is a distance away from the location that is hurting.
