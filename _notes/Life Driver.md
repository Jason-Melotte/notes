I wanted four areas of life that if balanced and in control would mean my life as a whole would be [[Life balance|balanced]] and in control.

- [[Mental Health]]
- [[Money]]
- [[Physical Health]]
- [[Relationships]]

In many ways [[Mental Health]] and [[Physical Health]] are one and shouldn't be looked at separately. The World Health Organization define [[health|health]][^1]:

> 
Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.

however I wanted to be able to track and plan for them separately. I also believe that whilst they are both as important as each other and one effects the other as with all the other drivers there is a [[Life balance|balance]] to be had between them and the other two drivers.
