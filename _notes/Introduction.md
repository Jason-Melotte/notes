This site is a collection of my notes that make up my mind rambling through various subjects.

This is predominately done for me so some of the 'rambles' here could well be hard to understand for people not living with my brain.

Also any views here are my own and not those of any organization I am connected with and as the name suggests are Ramblings rather than scientific fact therefore any actions a reader takes based on something they have read here must be at there own risk!

## Were to start
A few pointers to get you started:
* [[Pyramid of Life]]
* [[My Technology Stack]]
* [[The Outdoors]] *Coming Soon*
* [[bags and Stuff]] *Coming Soon*
