Money is a fairly obvious [[Life Driver]] in that we need it to live and life with out is sucks however it is also probably the easiest of the [[Life Driver|Drivers]] to be sucked into at the expense of balance.

Through my life I have definitely failed to get the balance correct in both directions.
